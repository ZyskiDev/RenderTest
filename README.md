Quick little addon-mod for litematica to only render held block in a schematic.

Toggle with '/togglespecific'

Might add it to the litematica config menu/hotkey if anyone cares enough to request it.

Compatability: 
It's built against litematica/malilib 1.21.4 but doesn't access any specific methods I know to be unique to these versions.
Going through every version to see if it's compatible is a chore, just let me know if it doesn't work on one and i'll make an exclusion list.
